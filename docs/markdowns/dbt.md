## Generate dbt models for analytics workflows

### Command: dbt
The `dbt` command generates dbt models based on the DBML (Database Markup Language) extracted from a source database. This DBML should have been generated by the previous (`extract`) command, providing a foundation for creating structured data transformations within `dbt`.

    rosetta [-c, --config CONFIG_FILE] dbt [-h, --help] [-s, --source CONNECTION_NAME]

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
-h, --help | Show the help message and exit.
-c, --config CONFIG_FILE | YAML config file.  If none is supplied it will use main.conf in the current directory if it exists.
-s, --source CONNECTION_NAME | The source connection name where models are generated.

##### Example Command:
Hereâ€™s a basic example command that uses the dbt function:

    rosetta dbt -s source_db_connection


**This command will:**
1. Use source_db_connection to locate the DBML generated from the extract command.
2. Generate corresponding dbt models that reflect the structure of the source database.

##### Additional Notes
- **Integration with dbt**: The generated `dbt` models allow for scalable and reusable SQL transformations, helping align your data structure with your analytics or ETL workflows.
- **Configuration**: Ensure that the configuration file (main.conf or specified config) contains accurate connection details for the source database, as it serves as the base for generating `dbt` models.
